VIEWSTART
---------	

problem, consider created 150 views in app, suddenly have to change the layout page name to new name. This time we have to change in all
		150 pages. Its not good and code repetation happens.


solution, create a common ViewStart view in root level becoause its common for all view pages.


working, When the app start to execute the ViewStart file execute first before other view file execute.
		-> Whatever layout is used in this page will be used in the opening view page.
		-> So code repetation (defining layout in every view page) can be removed.

Other Use
---------
-> If we want ot overright the layout of a particular view page, we can use Layout in that view file.
	-> This time the layout in the view file will be overright.

-> If we want some other layout for particular files (for a heirachy structure) we can create a new ViewStart file in that
	particular heirachy only.
