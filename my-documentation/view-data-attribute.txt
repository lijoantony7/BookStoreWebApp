VIEW DATA ATTRIBUTE
-------------------

public ViewResult Index()
{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Welcome Page";      -> Any type of value
    return View();
}


       ||
       \/


[ViewData]
public string Title {get; set;}
public ViewResult Index()                   -> specific type of value using ViewData attribute
{
    Title = "Welcome Page";
    return View();
}

Advantage
---------
Title passing in the particular view is now code repetation happening, using Title property in all the view page.
This can be removed by using attribute. Like above,
And in view page this can be removed.
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home";
}

for overriding the title, can use this code in the view page.
