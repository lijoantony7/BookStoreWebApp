Data adding in DB
-----------------

-> Create the DbContext instance in the class where we are gonna add the code for new Book (repository or in entity class).
	private readonly AppDbContext _dbContext;

	add this in the constructor of the current class.

	in creation method
		var newBook = new Book(){
			properties
			.
			.

		}

		_dbContext.Add(newBook);
		_dbContext.SaveChanges(); This line only hit the DB for adding data. (IMP*)

	In controller
		add appropiate method to call the above method and pass the data in it.

		In the controller
			public BookController ()
			{
				_bookRepository = new BookRepository;
			}

		we can't use like this. DI rule is should not create new object with new keyword.
		So handle this is program.cs by using service.addscoped<repo, repo>();

		and in controller like this
		public BookController (BookRepository bookRepository)
        {
            _bookRepository = bookRepository;
        }
