VALIDATIONS
-----------

Server side validation can be done by adding TagAttributes in model class:
	[Required( ErrorMessage = "Title is required." )]
        [StringLength( 100, ErrorMessage = "Title cannot be longer than 100 characters." )]
        public string Title { get; set; }

    -> Each time of form submiting the controller will hit and the server side validation do happen.
    -> This is NOT GOOD for client, cos each time its hittng controller affect the process.

Client side validation
----------------------

Instead of hitting at controller every time client side validation is better with server side validation.
    -> jquery.validation.js
    -> jquery.validation.unobtrusive.js
    can be used for that.

    -> add this client side libraries and add them in the layout page by order after .js

    For desabling client side validation, but not reccomented. For Developing purpose it can be used.
    builder.Services.AddRazorPages().AddRazorRuntimeCompilation().AddViewOptions( options =>
    {
        options.HtmlHelperOptions.ClientValidationEnabled = false;
    } );
