VIEW IMPORT.CSHTML
------------------


problem, consider created 150 views in app, suddenly have to change the @using directory in the page.
	-> here code repetation is happening, right? YES, @using directory is in all view files.

solution, create a common _ViewImport file in root level becoause its common for all view pages.

scope, its applicable for root level and sub folder level.
