Razor compilition takes place only two time
	-> Build
	-> Publish

It creates a probles while developing.
	-> It will run the razor when running the app so while changing the file in view page it won't affect the webpage on real time.

To resolve this problem, need to ENABLE RUN TIME COMPILITION
	-> Install new package from "microsft.aspdotnet.mvc.razor.runtimecompilition"

1. Install via NuGet Package
2. Add this service into (configure seervice) in program.cs file
3. make sure its compile only on develepment environement.
		#if DEBUG
			builder.Services.AddRazorPages().AddRazorRuntimeCompilation();
		#endif

		It will compile only on development env.
