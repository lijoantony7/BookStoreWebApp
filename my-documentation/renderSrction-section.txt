RENDERSECTION and SECTION

-> To run the js code for the specific page we can write it in the html page directly or spearte page.
	-> Problem is, js or script tag define at the bottom of the file, it executes at the last only. 
		JS can not be reacted once the rendering happens.
		In html the script is defined but rendringBody will get this js for the page. So the page with script will come inside the
		bodyRender() (inside the main tag) which will trigger an error.

		Avoiding this we can use rendersection()

SOLUTION
--------

RenderSection
	-> RenderSection is a space with a specific name and it is used on _Layout file.
	-> tells application that some other code (coming from view) will be placed here.

	@Section using in view.
	-> The section code will be replaced with RenderSection in layout file.



	This is solution layer.
